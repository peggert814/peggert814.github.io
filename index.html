        <p id="para-1">I am finally starting to get the hang of some of the abbreviations covered throughout the training content on <strong><a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a></strong> with careful <em>practice</em> and <em>repetition</em>; and it is becoming incresingly easier to recall and use them properly. I truly appreciate all the resources and training that is offered on this website and I find it extremely useful in keeping my mind sharp and utilizing/improving my computer/typing skills</p>

        <p>I am still exploring with a a lot of the different elements, ordering and phrasing of CSS and HTML but it's a lot of fun challenging myself and extremely rewarding seeing the final, successful result. I had always wondered what the process is for keeping a blog and how people go about updating/adding info and pictures and i'm starting to understand the inner-workings and it's exciting. <strong>Khan Academy</strong> is a great platform to learn the basics of coding/programming and it's offered in an engaging manner that's extremeley conducive to learning and overall info retention. </p>

        <p>My third entry is dedicated to the pure love of pupperinos. Can we take a moment of silence to appreciate and give thanks for all the loving kisses, cuddles and playful nature of these beatiful creatures? If you can think of any animal more loyal, caring, and affectionate then I implore you to disclose this info to me this instant so I may re-evaluate my life choices. Also, feel free to drop a line and send me any cute picks of your or anyone else's doggo you may have, they are more than welcome and definitely encouraged.<br><br>
